# Thoughts



What does Ruby or Python have?

## Node security project

Warn when any libraries are out of date
I think there's a project that already does this?
Embedded definitions, or query live?

Look through for open ones and see if you can come up with anything 

## Existing projects

https://github.com/ajinabraham/NodeJsScan/blob/master/rules.xml

## Rules

Enable/disable library specific rules by looking at the package.json?
Or if that's not possible, have a tool that suggests rules based on a given package.json?
Or if not package.json, we can definitely see what's `require`d into a file and base things on that

Secure cookies?

Things from `req.params` or `req.query` being passed into other fns? e.g. `fs.readFile`. Hard.

## Libraries

Look at the most popular on npm and check their issue trackers

### Restify

* Error: `.bodyParser()` must have `{mapParams: false}`
* File an issue/email on their tracker

### Express

Same as restify?
